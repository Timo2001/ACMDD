# Workflow of the practical
## Jupyter Notebooks
### Compound gathering
ChEMBL was queried to gather bioactivity data of the PTP1B data (Compounds.ipynb)
### Lipinski Filtering
The retrieved compounds of the query were filtered to comply with Lipinski rules (ADME-favourable.ipynb)
### Model creation
A classification model was built to classify MACCS keys on active or inactive labels (pIC50-model.ipynb)

## Google Colab
The DrugEx Demo framework was used (data_prep.ipynb, qsar.ipynb, de_novo.ipynb) by Martin Sicho was used (https://github.com/martin-sicho/drugex-demo)

## Jupyter Notebooks
### Filtering de novo compounds
#### Lipinski
The compounds were filtered on lipinski rules (Generated_Lipinski.ipynb)
#### Unwanted substructures
The compounds were filtered to delete unwanted substructures (Generated Unwanted Substructures.ipynb)
#### Active compounds
The left compounds were fed into the model (data/Activity_prediction.h5) to gather active compounds (Activity prediction generated.ipynb)
### Docking Compounds
PDB files of the PTP1B protein and co-crystalized ligand were first generated by usage of (https://github.com/jesperswillem/CBR_teaching/blob/main/01-Introduction%20to%20Bioinformatics..ipynb) and were then docked using (Docking.ipynb)
